## Overview

This project was completed to further enhance my skills I have learned so far with the foucs on this week's learnings on UX, advanced CSS and Bootstrap.

## Acceptance Criteria

To recreate my portfolio from last week, using Bootstrap, with some conditions, as below:

- A navigation bar: either Bootstrap or my own
- Links should be included that are applicable to portfolio and navigate to appropriate sections
- A jumbotron featuring the picture, name, and any other desired information
- Section about me, including skills expected to learn from this course
- A section displaying work in grid (Bootstrap): use Bootstrap cards for each project, with brief description of each. Each project should link to your projects.
- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect
- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover
- A footer section

## Portfolio Demo

The following animation shows my web aplication's appearance:

## My Process

Utilised same design from original portfolio but used Bootstrap components throughout my application, including below:

- Navbar
- Jumbotron
- Bootstrap grid built using Bootstrap Cards

I have customised styling of all Bootstrap components to recreate my original proftolio. This was a good exercise in terms of getting familiar with default component styles, selector precedence and the usage of CSS !important property.

## Built with...

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Advanced CSS
- Bootstrap
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

Bootstrap is essentialy flexbox but it simplifies the process of building responsive applications with it's built-in column system. Subsequently it reduces the need of using media queries.

I will utilise Bootstrap only where applicable in my future projects. I have learned that it is sometimes challenging to create more complex custom-made design, using Bootstrap due to default stylings.

Bootstrap 4.3. s still more prevalent on websites than its newer version.

## Useful Resources
