## Overview

This project was completed to further enhance my skills I have learned so far with the foucs on this week's learnings on UX, advanced CSS and Bootstrap.

## Acceptance Criteria

To recreate my portfolio from last week, using Bootstrap, with some conditions, as below:

- A navigation bar: A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
- Include links that are applicable to your portfolio. Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
- A hero section: A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
- Skills/ About Me section. List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
- A work section: A section displaying your work in grid. Use Bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work. Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
- A footer section

## Portfolio Demo

The following animation shows the web aplication's appearance:

## My Process

Utilised same design from original portfolio but used Bootstrap components throughout my application, including below:

- Navbar
- Jumbotron
- Bootstrap gird built using Bootstrap Cards

I have customised styling of all Bootstrap components to recreate my original proftolio. This was a good exercise in terms of getting familiar with default component styles, selector precedence and the usage of CSS !important property.

## Built with...

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Advanced CSS
- Bootstrap
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

Bootstrap is essentialy flexbox but it simplifies the process of building responsive applications with it's built-in column system. Subsequently it reduces the need to use media queries.

I will utilise Bootstrap only where applicable in my future projects as I have learned that it is sometimes challenging to create more complex custom-made design, using Bootstrap due to default stylings.

Bootstrap 4.3. s still more prevalent on websites than a new version.

## Useful Resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This was a nice refresher I kept open during the initial stages to ensure I apply these in my project.
